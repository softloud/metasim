  abstract = {We investigate the impact of diﬀerent sampling techniques on the performance of multiobjective optimization methods applied to costly black-box optimization problems. Such problems are often solved using an algorithm in which a surrogate model approximates the true objective function and provides predicted objective values at a lower cost. As the surrogate model is based on evaluations of a small number of points, the quality of the initial sample can have a great eﬀect on the overall eﬀectiveness of the optimization. In this study, we demonstrate how various sampling techniques aﬀect the results of applying diﬀerent optimization algorithms to a set of benchmark problems. Additionally, some recommendations on usage of sampling methods are provided.},

  abstract = {Computers are a central tool in the research process, enabling complex and large-scale data analysis. As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

  shorttitle = {D-Dimer in Preeclampsia},
  abstract = {Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is associated with microvasculature fibrin deposition and maternal organ dysfunction. D-dimer (D-Di) has been used as a marker of production/degradation of fibrin in vivo. D-Di has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool for thrombotic conditions because its plasma concentration has a high negative predictive value for venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate publications that assessed plasma D-Di in preeclampsia and normotensive pregnant subjects to define its diagnostic value. A total of 194 publications were identified. Following the exclusion process, seven studies were in accordance with the pre-defined eligibility criteria. This systematic review was performed with methodologic accuracy, including a careful definition of preeclampsia and a high sensitivity literature search strategy. Quality of the included studies was assessed in accordance with widely accepted literature recommendations. Our meta-analysis indicates that increased plasma D-Di is associated with preeclampsia in the third trimester of gestation vs normotensive pregnant subjects. These preliminary findings in this select group of patients clearly highlight the need for additional comprehensive studies throughout pregnancy, including the establishment of an appropriate cut-off, in order to fully elucidate the diagnostic/prognostic role of D-Di in preeclampsia.},
