  abstract = {We investigate the impact of diﬀerent sampling techniques on the performance of multiobjective optimization methods applied to costly black-box optimization problems. Such problems are often solved using an algorithm in which a surrogate model approximates the true objective function and provides predicted objective values at a lower cost. As the surrogate model is based on evaluations of a small number of points, the quality of the initial sample can have a great eﬀect on the overall eﬀectiveness of the optimization. In this study, we demonstrate how various sampling techniques aﬀect the results of applying diﬀerent optimization algorithms to a set of benchmark problems. Additionally, some recommendations on usage of sampling methods are provided.},

  abstract = {Background: We sometimes want to include in a meta-analysis data from studies where results are presented as medians and ranges or interquartile ranges rather than as means and standard deviations. In this paper I extend a method of Hozo et al. to estimate mean and standard deviation from median, minimum, and maximum to the case where quartiles are also available.Methods: Inequalities are developed for each observation using upper and lower limits derived from the minimum, the three quartiles, and the maximum. These are summed to give bounds for the sum and hence the mean of the observations, the average of these bounds in the estimate. A similar estimate is found for the sum of the observations squared and hence for the variance and standard deviation.Results: For data from a Normal distribution, the extended method using quartiles gives good estimates of sample means but sample standard deviations are overestimated. For data from a Lognormal distribution, both sample mean and standard deviation are overestimated. Overestimation is worse for larger samples and for highly skewed parent distributions. The extended estimates using quartiles are always superior in both bias and precision to those without.Conclusions: The estimates have the advantage of being extremely simple to carry out. I argue that as, in practice, such methods will be applied to small samples, the overestimation may not be a serious problem.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact—that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable—is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it’s critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.},

A number of the trials, however, reported the study using the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles. Hence, in order to combine results, one may have to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials.},

  abstract = {Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is associated with microvasculature fibrin deposition and maternal organ dysfunction. D-dimer (D-Di) has been used as a marker of production/degradation of fibrin in vivo. D-Di has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool for thrombotic conditions because its plasma concentration has a high negative predictive value for venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate publications that assessed plasma D-Di in preeclampsia and normotensive pregnant subjects to define its diagnostic value. A total of 194 publications were identified. Following the exclusion process, seven studies were in accordance with the pre-defined eligibility criteria. This systematic review was performed with methodologic accuracy, including a careful definition of preeclampsia and a high sensitivity literature search strategy. Quality of the included studies was assessed in accordance with widely accepted literature recommendations. Our meta-analysis indicates that increased plasma D-Di is associated with preeclampsia in the third trimester of gestation vs normotensive pregnant subjects. These preliminary findings in this select group of patients clearly highlight the need for additional comprehensive studies throughout pregnancy, including the establishment of an appropriate cut-off, in order to fully elucidate the diagnostic/prognostic role of D-Di in preeclampsia.},
