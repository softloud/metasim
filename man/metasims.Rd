\usage{
metasims(single_study, distributions = default_parameters, k = c(3, 7,
  10), tau2_true = seq(from = 0, to = 0.4, by = 0.2),
  median_ratio = c(1, 1.2), prop = 0.3, trials = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{single_study}{logical indicating if k takes only one value, k = 1.}

\item{k}{Simulate for different numbers of studies.}

\item{tau2_true}{Variance \eqn{\gamma_k \sim N(0, \tau^2)} associated with the random effect}

\item{median_ratio}{\eqn{\nu_I / \nu_C := \rho} where \eqn{\rho} denotes the ratio of medians.}

\item{prop}{Proportion of sample size we expect to cohorts to vary by most of
the time}

\item{probar}{Turn progress bar on and off.}
