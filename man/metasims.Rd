\arguments{
\item{single_study}{Set this to TRUE for a simulation of single samples; i.e., one control and one intervention group.}

\item{measure}{Calculate sample median or mean. Defaults to median.}

\item{measure_spread}{Specify "iqr", "range", "sd", "var". Will have to check how many of these are done right now.}

\item{distributions}{a dataframe with a \code{dist} column of R distributions, i.e., norm, exp, pareto, and a list-column \code{par} of parameter sets. Defaults to \link{default_parmetres}}

\item{k}{Vector of desired numbers studies to simulate for.}

\item{tau_sq_true}{Variance \eqn{\gamma_k \sim N(0, \tau^2)} associated with the random effect}

\item{unequal_effect_ratio}{\eqn{\nu_I / \nu_C := \rho} where \eqn{\rho = 1} and whatever arguments passed to this. Defaults to 1.2, so that the cases \eqn{\rho = 1, 1.2} are considered.}

\item{min_n}{lower bound for sample sizes, defaults to 20}

\item{max_n}{upper bound for sample sizes, defaults to 200}

\item{prop}{proportion of n we expect}

\item{prop_error}{what do we expect 90% of proportions to fall within?}

\item{beep}{Turn on beep alert when successfully finished.}

\item{progress}{Turn progress bar on and off.}

\item{single_study}{When set to TRUE, will override simulation parameters with k = 1 and tau_sq_true = 0.}

\item{k}{Simulate for different numbers of studies.}
