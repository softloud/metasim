Simulation results for the number of confidence intervals 
  that contain the true measure of interest, the median and, log-ratio of the control median with intervention median. The case where the control median is equal to the intervention median is considered, as is unequal ratio = 1,1.2. The distributions considered were the normal distribution, with parameters 2 and 0.3, the exponential distribution, with parameters 2, the Pareto distribution, with parameters 3 and 3, the Pareto distribution, with parameters 2 and 1, the Pareto distribution, with parameters 0.5 and 1, the log-normal distribution, with parameters 1 and 0.3.
